The company deployed its application as containers on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and the database was in Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). However, the application and database were located in two separate AWS regions, leading to latencies and distrust in the deployment process. The cost of maintaining full infrastructure in both regions was high, and the company needed to reduce its cost spending.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",goal_title:"Objective",goal_description:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThe objective of the case study is to highlight the steps taken by a collaborative social media platform to reduce the monthly recurring cost of its infrastructure and improve the reliability of its deployment process.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",solution_title:"Solution",solution_description:"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ECompany approached the problem by consolidating its infrastructure and automating its deployment process.
